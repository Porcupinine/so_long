# so_long
This project is part of Codam's rank 2 and was my first attempt on a graphic project. 
To be able to run the game don't forget to clone it using --recurse-submodules, as it depends 
on MLX42 and my ouwn libft llibrary.

To run MLX42 you are going to need some libraries, please refer to MLX42 to install everything 
that i needed. 

in order to play the game you first need to run make and execute so_long folowed by the map you
want to try. There is a folder with a couple maps, some vallid, some invalid. Feel free to creat 
new maps as well.

If you are curious about my wierd choice of character and collectables, here is a bit of context
and a Brazilian folklore legend for you!

In South America we get to have pink river dolphins! YES! they are piiiink!!! but also very wirdly 
shaped. And in Brazil we call them "Boto-cor-de-rosa", and they tend to be very frendly.

In the north of the country we have a folklore tale that says that one is able to turn himself into 
a very handsome guy and seduce single ladies, the ladies get pregnant and the boto goes back to the 
river.
